The Let’s Encrypt project 
==================
The Let’s Encrypt project is a nonprofit organization that offers free SSL certificates to the internet.

The team behind this movement want all users on our global village Web securely encrypted with an https:// URL, which will prevent third parties like hackers and government agencies from reading what you're doing online - they can't tell who you are or where in particular your information might exist without breaking encryption!
